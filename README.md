## Problem Description
The Convex Hull of a set of points is defined as the unique smallest "envelope" that contains all of the points. In the image shown below, the blue envelope does qualify
as a convex hull, while the black one does not. A 3-dimensional extension can also be seen below. With potential applications in image processing, this repository contains
a divide-and-conquer implementation of the algorithm.
